# Cypres
Cypres is a Web Application used to help users around the Greater Toronto Area report incidents around the city. Once a user logs the incident, they can keep track of the incident until it has been resolved. Users are able to provide a short description, a location, and contact information within the incident report. 

Cypres is a group project for an Introduction to Software Engineering course (CPS 406) at Ryerson University.
